# -Data-Visualization-and-Storytelling
## 📁Project Overview  
This project focuses on **exploratory data visualization and storytelling** using a **Superstore-style sales dataset**.  
It demonstrates how data-driven visuals can uncover key business insights and support strategic decisions through a structured report.

---

##  Objectives  
- Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on retail sales data.  
- Create **visualizations** that communicate insights clearly.  
- Build a **storyboard** connecting KPIs, performance trends, and recommendations.  
- Generate a **professional PDF report** summarizing all findings.

---

##  Dataset  
A **synthetic Superstore dataset** was generated for analysis, containing 800+ sales records (2020–2022).  

**Key columns include:**  
- `OrderDate` – Transaction date  
- `Region` – West, East, Central, South  
- `Category` / `Sub-Category` – Product classification  
- `Sales` and `Profit` – Financial performance indicators  
- `Quantity`, `OrderPriority`, `CustomerName` – Operational attributes  

📄 **Dataset file:** `synthetic_superstore.csv`
